    This MQMFTCredentials.xml file defines the access credentials required for MQMFT agents and loggers
    to funtion.
    Credentials can take one of two possible forms.
    (1) Logger credential definitions with a user id and password that will be used to connect to a
        database where the loggers tables can be found.
    (2) File credential definitions with a password that will be used to access an SSL key or trust
        store file
    (3) MQ queue manager connection credentials. Entries are indexed by name (queue manager) and optional
        user (requesting the connection) and the matching entry will contain the user id and password
        authentication details to connect to the queue manager. These may be in clear text or obfuscated.
        MQCSP Authentication can also be enabled here which allows to flow passwords up to 256 characters
        in length.By default Compatibility mode is used when authenticating with a queue manager.

    Use one of the following elements to define each of the credential types.

    Logger user id and password credential

       <tns:logger name="logger-name" user="database-user" password="database-password" />

    With attribute values
        name is the name of the logger these credentials are associated with.
        user is the database user to be used by the logger to connect to its database.

    or

        password is the password used to access the store file.
        
    or
    
    QMGR authentication details
    
    <tns:qmgr name="CoordQueueMgr" user="John" mqUserId="John" mqPassword="JohnsPassword" />
    
    With attribute values
        name is the name of the queue manager the credentials is for.
        user is the optional users name requesting the connection, if missing then applies to all users.
        mqUserId is the user id to be supply with the MQ connection request.
        mqPassword is the associated password for the MQ connection request. 
        mqUserIdCipher same as mqUserId but obfuscated.
